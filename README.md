# 📌 User Registration Problem
This repository (user-registration-problem) contains a Python-based user registration system that ensures users provide valid credentials while maintaining logs for easy debugging.

## 🚀 Features Implemented
The registration system validates the following inputs:
✅ **First Name** – Must start with a capital letter.  
✅ **Last Name** – Must start with a capital letter.  
✅ **Email ID** – Must be a valid email format.  
✅ **Phone Number** – Must include a country code, followed by a valid number.  
✅ **Password Requirements**:  
   - Minimum 8 characters  
   - At least 1 uppercase letter  
   - At least 1 numeric digit  
   - Exactly 1 special character  

### 🛠️ Logging Implementation
✔ Tracks user input validation.  
✔ Records invalid attempts.  
✔ Makes debugging easier.  

## 🧪 Testing with Pytest
We have used `pytest` for testing the user registration functionality.  
To run tests, use the following command:  pytest test_user_registration.py -v or pytest test_user_registration.py
